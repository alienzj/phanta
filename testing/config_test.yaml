# Specifications for step one - classification of metagenomic reads
confidence_threshold: 0.1 # increase to reduce false positives - range from 0-1
gzipped: True # True or False - are the read files gzipped?
class_mem: 32 # memory in GB, must be at least 32
class_threads: 16 # see usage instructions - can increase if you have more threads available; no need to change if you have fewer

# Speciications for step three - per-species abundance estimation
